Behind this incident there is a legal problem which hampered the contract award . According to the resolution declaring void the reverse auction ( issued November 6 ) on October 30 Colanta LTDA cooperative was presented as a bidder . & quot ; To open the tender process had to count on a technical endorsement that gave us the Planning Department in July this year . Then we evaluate all the nutritional requirements that were needed . & quot ; The opening of the tender was published on 17 October 2013 . & quot ; The process is declared wilderness because sobo and it was a bidder did not comply with the financial capacity , & quot ; explains Castro . Coverage in early childhood education the mayor says that there is no deficit at present , & quot ; the ICBF has 12 gardens and the Ministry of Social Integration 45 . This is a community mothers support and resources exist : mothers Community handed them budget availability certificate guaranteeing that $ 150 million per year are intended for dairy foods . & quot ; Draws attention , Castro says , that this manifestation arises just as the Government Department evaluates a medley of local mayors : & quot ; Most mothers were misinformed . It is necessary to establish a bond of communication because it is not true that the law guarantees interrupt the nutrition of 4,105 children .

        "Education-->General Population-->HOODED placing barricades , using incendiary bombs , assault two quarters of police in Providencia and Santiago , destroying public and private property and confrontations with the police , among other things , were again the trend of serious incidents that occurred yesterday in Santiago after the call for general strike by the Date and which they joined other organizations such as CUT , copper workers , dockers and post . The incidents in different parts of the capital and in regions began even before the start of the march had been authorized by the Metropolitan Municipality , which shows clearly that it was pre - arranged and criminal actions that were intended to cause disturbance of public order . Although there were dozens of arrests during the protest , no progress was still known in identifying who really are behind these acts of vandalism , organize and instigate . It is unacceptable that the high cost of these criminal actions always end up paying the innocent citizens who only want to live their lives in peace and whose work is affected each time it calls for marches and protests of this nature , which are known in advance end in violent incidents . It is noteworthy that the discourse of university and secondary school leaders have changed substantially in recent times : before and took away repudiated the intervention of the hooded ; Now , however , a majority sector supports unquestioningly folds or violent occupations which have taken place in the headquarters of the University of Chile and the Ministry of Education . This validation of unlawful methods of protest bordering on complicity , because in addition to give justification to those who drive the violence , create a hostile environment towards the police , who looks so difficult act to prevent abuses and crime . This radicalization of speech and protest actions makes it increasingly difficult to fulfill the obligation of the authorities to maintain public order . This calls for a work of intelligence to provide information to enable the violence and an efficient management of the security forces , within the framework established by law for that purpose . At the same time , this radicalization is essential that those who have leadership positions in student organizations , faculty or the universities themselves , and understand the damage it does to the exercise of the right to demonstrate peacefully , unambiguously reject such actions and isolate who drive them . Special care and caution must assume presidential candidates and leaders of different political sectors , avoiding the temptation to justify any nature to these protests and thus political gain . The weakness in the rule of law and respect for the rights of others - reality which unfortunately is already possible constatar - is a problem that should particularly worry those who aspire to lead the country & # 39 ; s destiny in a future presidential term .\n",

By Rodolfo Ortiz sucesos @ eldiariodehoy.com26 . mar . 2015 | 9:02 As part of the March for Life , Peace and Justice , organized by the Government and the National Public Safety Council , President Salvador Sanchez Ceren said it will promote reintegration of gang law . It also announced it will introduce a regulation to work with people at risk of joining gangs and processes to reintegrate into society members of these criminal structures . & quot ; I want to announce that soon will present Act Reintegration Gangs and Prevention for People at Risk , which we hope will be approved soon and by consensus in the Legislative Assembly , & quot ; the president said before a crowd that the government estimated at 300,000 people , at the monument to the Divine Savior of the World . & quot ; We will be open to work for the development and welfare of the country with those who abandon the path of hatred and darkness , & quot ; then he added , referring to the work done by the National Council of Public Safety . Despite being a very relevant ad and will certainly involve other sectors of society in its implementation , Sanchez Ceren said nothing more about this new law . The speech did not include details on the actions to be taken to reintegrate gang members into society , what you mean or how reintegration prevent more young people are recruited by these criminal groups . However , the president stressed that & quot ; we are all indispensable & quot ; in society and spoke about rescuing communities and live in harmony . . . & quot ; coexistence involving & quot ; boot hatred from our hearts and learn to be tolerant , & quot ; he said . In addition , asked the religious , civil servants and students in the square to establish new relations of friendship and love within Salvadoran families . Thousands of people came in different gears to Salvador del Mundo monument , symbol of the nation . Most would dressed in white and rose blue and white flags . In the earlier days , the march was criticized because it was reported that many public and school employees would have to manifest itself . Despite being a day off at the end of the concentration there was a huge congestion around the Savior of the World and motorists complained that the police did not resolve . Combating crime On the other hand , the president thanked the Legislature and the Supreme Court to approve the Antiextorsiones law and toughen penalties for those that threaten the lives of police officers and members of the Army . & quot ; I am grateful . . . for the government to provide the tools to make the work more effective in the fight against crime , & quot ; he said . Sanchez Ceren said the state will not leave unpunished the deaths of the security officials and gang members killed by citizens . He reiterated that with the National Public Safety Council & quot ; apply the law with firmness to defeat crime of any kind & quot ; . So far the government authorities have not mentioned how the application of sentences to criminals coexist with reintegration law being drafted at the Presidential Palace , without these new rules involved with justice . Along with the rhetoric of & quot ; not giving any step against crime & quot ; , the speech of the march was accompanied by a stand in favor of prevention and reconciliation . Part of prevention efforts be undertaken by the Executive is targeting resources and government programs in municipalities and most vulnerable to crime and gang territories . New stance For just over a decade Salvadoran state policy in the area of \u200b\u200b security , has focused on repression and punishment of crime without such a strategy has prevented increases in homicides and extortions . In July 2003 , former President Francisco Flores announced the Mano Dura plan , which sought to tighten control over gangs . The implementation of the initiative included raids and arrests of several members of these structures . The administrations of presidents Elias Antonio Saca and Mauricio Funes also counted with its own laws prioritized arrests and imprisonments . But the gang managed to consolidate its logistics and chain of command taking the saturation of the prison system . Most Salvadorans who suffer extortion is ordered from prison . In March 2012 the so - called truce between gangs , a process in which the gang agreed to reduce the number of homicides in exchange for reducing the severity of some control measures in prisons was known . In public opinion this truce included the delivery of some weapons , even against authorities of the Organization of American States , and repeated calls to other actors of civil society dialogue support . However gang refused at all times to stop extorting or disarm the population . Eventually the initiative came to a standstill and 2015 homicide levels have returned to exceed 10 murders a day , rising to 15 per day in March . The law of reintegration would be the first institutional initiative to try to separate the crime and reintegrate gang members . However judicial controls , requirements , facilities and other aspects including the rules are unknown .
