Employees of the National University involved in the strike rejected a statement issued Wednesday by the directives of the institution in which they say that if they have complied with the agreement . However , the workers insist that is not true . They point out that last November an agreement in which it notes that the Board of Governors who must approve the salary increase was signed , but to date this has not happened . Demonstrators released the situation the Ministry of Labour , where they were informed that it was necessary that three ministries met to discuss the issue . & quot ; They decided to make a tripartite commission between various ministries to study the proposal when that was not the agreement . The pact was that what was produced together was what had to approve the Board of Governors to get the resources for the wage increase for workers , & quot ; he told one of the workers in dialogue with Radio Blu . In this regard he added that the statements issued by the university are a fallacy . & quot ; We will continue indefinitely permanent assembly until the national government and the university administration would meet the workers & quot ; . On Friday a meeting will be held in other cities , especially in Medellin , to define if they join the movement . Wednesday several students joined the protest .

The union said a & quot ; profound rejection of the pronouncements made by the Uruguayan political and social right & quot ; defending & quot ; the interests of the ruling classes & quot ; . In that sense , the coach Jorge Bermudez said that & quot ; the Uruguayan right aims to become an advocate alleged Venezuelan student groups , which are actually handled by the reaction in the country & quot ; and compared his position on foreign issues with which it has on Uruguayans . & quot ; Defend students in Venezuela , and here proposed lowering the age of criminal responsibility to be sent as soon as possible to prison on suspicion of being young is a crime , & quot ; said Bermudez . On the other hand , the leader criticized the & quot ; big media , like CNN , & quot ; which & quot ; are intended to present a blurred reality of the current situation in the neighboring country & quot ; and & quot ; rudely manipulated information , presenting photos of events violent happening elsewhere in the world and wanting them to pass as actions in Venezuela & quot ; . The proclamation read by the union leader stated that the Venezuelan government support is also a way of thanking the solidarity that has had with Uruguay , when it supported the Hospital of Clinics , the Funsa , and Bandes . Meanwhile , workers union stated that & quot ; the oligarchy & quot ; does not accept peace & quot ; convened by President Maduro & quot ; because that way , & quot ; the truth about who stirred the ghost of death & quot ; will be found . & quot ; When the truth is found today who will be paid by the CIA , shaken and sent young people to the beating with the same recipe they tried to do in the 2001 coup against President Chavez , & quot ; he said Bermudez . At the rally was present Venezuelan Deputy Jose Alfredo Ure\u00f1a , who chairs the Parliamentary Friendship Group between Venezuela and Uruguay . Asked by The Observer , the legislator denied that the deaths in Venezuela in recent days have been the result of government repression . & quot ; The American empire threatens once again to democracy , pay snipers and gunmen paid to destabilize us . Is a clear evidence that what & # 39 ; s in Venezuela is an attempt of coup paid by the Americans , for a ground for the invasion is paid , & quot ; said Ure\u00f1a , who said that the opposition & quot ; has killed people in their own ranks & quot ; . He also said that students are not peaceful home & quot ; burned police cars and truckloads of food , schools burned , damaged buildings , and we as a humanist government does not have repressed & quot ; . Facing opposition allegations that the National Guard has fired on demonstrators , the Venezuelan deputy told The Observer that & quot ; not true & quot ; . & quot ; There is still not the first dead of repression of the Bolivarian revolution , & quot ; he said . As for the shortage of goods that suffers Venezuela , Ure\u00f1a insisted that is the result of the smuggling is done to Colombia . & quot ; Almost half of the products that we fund out smuggled into Colombia , & quot ; he said , and then concluded that it is & quot ; another US strategy to prepare the ground for an invasion & quot ; . Among those approached Cagancha Square to show solidarity with the Venezuelan government was Suzanne Sena , known as the & quot ; Bolivarian & quot ; , wearing a military uniform and slung the red and blue flag , yellow . While it is Uruguayan , he lived 21 years in Venezuela . In 1995 he returned to Uruguay , so he did not live the government of Hugo Chavez . Sena told The Observer that got to have a close relationship with the late President Hugo Chavez . & quot ; I met him because when he came , talked a lot with me . I was the only one who could get close to him and always told me & # 39 ; You never fail me , & # 39 ; & quot ; said the demonstrator . In March he plans to travel to Venezuela to support the President Maduro , and which , he said , & quot ; the media do not tell the truth . & quot ; & quot ; The students burned 40 buses and subway because subway Maduro was a driver . But he is too democratic , because it allows you exit or a bullet . He knows that if the people out on the street turns into a slaughter , & quot ; he said . Moreover , Sena also believes that what is happening in Venezuela is America & # 39 ; s fault . & quot ; It is proven that the millions of dollars given to the opposition protests are generated . They wanted to kill Leopoldo Lopez for the opposition to have its martyr , and they wanted to blame us . They are the recorded conversations and know who it was . It is all documented , can not deny , & quot ; he said . \n",

Nom\u00e1s peek at the last three polls published over the horizon : At least until November , Ivonne exceeded not only the other PRI , but also to any PAN , including its potential rival , Margarita Arellanes , that they are not bad singing rancheras as of popularity . . . But there he goes a very interesting fact : between June and November , Mrs. Ivonne & quot ; he turned the tables . & quot ; Being two points down Margarita , you will be climbed and got three points above . . . If this trend continues , the PAN should worry ! . . . Let & # 39 ; s see ! * * * Poooor way , with this the & quot ; official anointing & quot ; , tomorrow the city center will host PRI saturated with closed streets and the whole thing , so take . . .

So much so , that it made accusations that rather resembled a suit tailored to Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Perez Bernal and the same Felipe de Jesus Cantu , noting that applicants do not touch the issue of corruption . . . . By the way , who continues to receive expressions of support is nothing more and nothing less than the former mayor of Monterrey , Felipe de Jesus Cantu .

Without wanting wanting called him old , realizing the importance of giving way to new youths to govern because it has certain affinities . . . . Although it has been maintained very well glued in chamba as Town Clerk , Chuy Hurtado , took advantage of the occasion to make rounds of shadow .

The official believes shares to pay the increase promised in December negative entrerriana police decided to extend the protest and reported that remain mobilized in Piazza Concordia until it receives a response . The announcement raised fears that the events of December repitan.Y these facts alone serious he joined another . Both the Church and the Concordia Trade Center in a statement contradicted the position of the Attorney General of the STJ , Jorge Garcia , and entrerriano Executive , about the agreement signed by the governor and police autoacuartelados 9 last December it is null for extortion . Garcia is the one who speaks the subject ; Urribarri , who accepted it with their silence and , in practice , the fact of not having paid the agreed increases . & quot ; Before us , no party expressed signed under pressure . The immediate solution to the conflict was a claim of all citizens , given the prevailing situation of chaos and violence . Declare void the signed exclusive competence of the judiciary , by final judgment , & quot ; said the statement , signed by Walter Kleiman , head of the Centre for Trade and one of the negotiators of the night of 9 , and the representative of the bishop Luis Collazuol , Emmanuel Bonetta ( Collazuol is in C\u00f3rdoba ) . & quot ; There was nothing to express extortion , or during the negotiations or subsequent days , & quot ; Clarin said Bonetta .

And they insist that one thing is the media views of Attorney and other legal ruling that does not exist and annul it signed . In Concordia , Clarin checked the tense calm : nothing seemed out of control . In social networks , however , it is beginning to show psychosis and flew over the fear of new riots . On December 9 , Concordia burned . Looting , they blocked roads , barricades , armed neighbors , autoacuartelados police not moved to restore order . They demanded wage increases and the governor was the chief negotiator Urribarri . At 8 pm , both sides agreed . Minutes later , the police backed down : the increase was black . Amid the tension , Urribarri insisted that he had no funds , . Then , & quot ; both the Governor and the police asked the help of the Bishop of Concordia and the Center for Trade and Industry to facilitate dialogue & quot ; , recalls the statement yesterday of the Church . So they sat down at the table . The situation was still locked and the police announced they were withdrawing . & quot ; At that time , the bishop responded : if dilate more , he said , count me as a guarantor , & quot ; Roberto Niez told Clarin . There were calls , each party gave something and signed . The data does not seem to match the position to extortion .
