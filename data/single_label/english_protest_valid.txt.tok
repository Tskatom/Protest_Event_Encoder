Because of this problem the Municipality had already requested a police guard . However , he explained the union leader , the officers fail to keep out unauthorized classifiers that daily enter the premises of the landfill . & quot ; The administration has pledged to clear the area outside the plant classifiers , and so far it has not done , & quot ; Soto claimed . & quot ; The problem is that workers can not get a truck if people are rating and also do so without the slightest sanitation , & quot ; added the leader . Soto said the union asked classifiers Montevideo ( Ucrus ) to mediate with classifiers . & quot ; We know that those who go to landfill are not affiliated with Ucrus , but maybe they can do something to reach an understanding , & quot ; said Soto . According manifest landfill workers , it is common classifiers rather withdraw huge bag and loaded into special trucks that arrive at the farm , or in horse - drawn carts . Yesterday , during the measurement , more than 1,000 containers were not empty . The situation began to normalize just over 17 hours . & quot ; If it happens again we will take the same measure until the administration to act , & quot ; said Soto .

Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo blamed the fact to the capital Multisectoral a space where different parties and leftist student organizations , opposition to the national government . Both the Popular Movement Patria Grande , and the University Federation of La Plata repudiated episode , while called for reflection to political groups responsible for that event , which was held in the Plaza San Martin de La Plata .

It also condemned & quot ; the unilateral decision to bring forward who defined this unfortunate action , forgetting the collective nature of the call . & quot ; Lucas Pasari , PTS , said his organization & quot ; under any point of view & quot ; agrees with this , which he described as & quot ; unacceptable & quot ; . The leftist militant who claimed ignorance of the dolls drew up and burned , and PTS was already in the square when the fire occurred . & quot ; At no time discussed in the appearance of burn Multisectoral a Mother . We not only disclaim the fact , but we are absolutely against & quot ; the site said Pasari Francisco Urondo . On Monday 23 leftist organizations staged a demonstration at a new anniversary of the coup . When the march reached its end , the demonstrators arrived at one of the main squares of La Plata , San Martin , and after reading a statement , some burned two dolls , one representing the Chief of the General Staff of the Army , César Milani and another to the Mother of Plaza de Mayo , Hebe de Bonafini . The Multisectoral La Plata , Berisso and Ensenada which called the march under the slogans & quot ; No to impunity for past and present & quot ; , is made by the Party of Socialist Workers ( PTS ) , the Workers Party ( PO ) , the Coordinator against Police and Institutional Repression ( CORREPI ) , Big Country , the University Federation de la Plata ( FULP ) and one of the two organizations in La Plata CHILDREN . From the Twitter account of Casa Rosada , he was awarded the fact forces left . On Thursday , PO issued a statement blaming the national government to award this to the force : & quot ; The PO categorically denies having participated in the burning of an effigy figures of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo along with others in the demonstration Milani on March 23 in the city of La Plata . We condemn this baseless accusation comes from the government itself , as evidenced by its diffusion from the Twitter account of the Casa Rosada , instead of fulfilling an institutional role has become an element of political defamation against the opposition . & quot ; And later , CHILDREN La Plata issued a statement admitting the fact : & quot ; First we clarify the direction , editing and burning of two dolls burned in the square , Milani hugged Hebe , is our exclusive action and responsibility therefore . disclaim responsibility of all groups and individuals who were part of the organization of the march and the act of March 23 .

Some who a few years ago were together in the street , fighting for trial and punishment of all genocides and not cut judgments , which were part of the glorious days of 19 and 20 December , are now as if to light the struggle years . We believe that is impossible that this administration K , with its merely symbolic politics , kindle in reality the country we dream , they dreamed 30,000 fellow detainees disappeared and all the fallen in the fight . Mainly because we do not believe that K project is the construction destinations twist of history , because today it is still valid logic to respond with all the & quot ; weight of the law & quot ; the incontestable legitimacy of popular demands , because the distribution struggle continues tilting the counterweight balance to the haves , and that the majority will of either way there when the transformer is built step genuinely seriously . & quot ; & quot ; The support of the repressor Milani in front of the Army would not have been possible without this political operation of reconciliation with the armed forces . That Hebe Pastor de Bonafini and Association who told us for years that & quot ; whoever comes to state compensation are prostitutes & quot ; who emptied their & quot ; People & # 39 ; s University & quot ; of the best left intellectuals when they veered to the right , and who entered the Plaza this 24 in a collective narrowed a hypocrite embrace with Anibal Fernandez and Carlos Tomada , are those who today feel horrified because we show in a symbolic act that all society knows , moves us to propose a debate that , sorry , should be given only by the burning of an effigy . At the four winds , and from right to left , for years we have been denouncing the cooptation and today denounce the attempt at reconciliation . So we do not accept demonizen , from left to right , when what we are trying to do is promote discussion . & quot ; RELATED

France neighboring park , located in the 105 street race 15 , in the town of Usaquén not want to see more sex workers in the streets . They argue that for 10 years , this residential area has become the workplace of a group of prostitutes arriving from 6:00 pm to offer his services to drivers passing through the area . Worried and tired of inappropriate scenes in your industry , ask the District to relocate to sex workers and reclaim public space . Although several years have denounced the situation , the voice of protest grew louder last Friday . At 10:00 pm , several residents of the neighborhood Santa Barbara came out with placards in hand , marching . With messages like & quot ; Stop prostitution in this site & quot ; or & quot ; For our children , not to the presence of sex workers in our neighborhoods & quot ; , he was asked once again to the final management solutions . For them , the most affected are the children who have to witness this activity daily . & quot ; They exhibitionists actions from 6:00 pm They show breasts if one goes out there , whether or not we with our children . We are also concerned that public spaces are being used for services . There are people who go out to jog early and finds these people having sex . Not to mention the waste left : condoms are scattered throughout the park . This is also a public health issue , & quot ; said Adriana Cabra , inhabitant of the sector . The neighbors also complain that there are clandestine establishments engaged to provide sex workers and camouflage themselves as places where other services provided . & quot ; For example , compared to the gas station 104 street race 15 operates an establishment that offers massage , but it really is a place of prostitution , & quot ; complained Cabra . It is also a priority for citizens to send a message to customers , who , according to them , are as responsible for this situation as workers . Daly Luz Molina , a resident of the area , with its manifestations these people intended to raise awareness that theirs is not suitable for search or neighborhood to offer these services because that & # 39 ; s what the tolerance zones , such as the Santa Fe . Before Friday & # 39 ; s protest , sex workers responded aggressively , throwing bottles and stones at the demonstrators . Police had to intervene to prevent injuries . Cindy , one of the sex workers said that economic activity is legal and that the law allows you to offer your work in public space , provided they do not provide their service in these areas . He added that they would accept to be relocated , but neither the district nor the inhabitants have proposed a roundtable . Vicky , who works in this sector since 15 years , this argument must be added that the claims must also be for customers and authorities . & quot ; The industry pays very well . In one night I earn up to $ 800,000 . If the customer does not come , then we would not be here . As for the authorities , they also allow it . Many workers spend their $ 30,000 a night and they do not see anything . This is a double moral standing , & quot ; said the worker . The truth is that for the authorities has not been easy to address the issue . Now there are three police officers who have been dismissed for allegations of abuse and discrimination . Colonel Carlos Hernandez Roldan , commander of the police station of Usaquen , said the support the community has been ongoing , so there is a better coexistence between them and their neighbors , adding that while the District does not take action , they do not They can withdraw the workers , unless they violate the Code of Police . The response of the local mayor does not improve the situation as the people wanted . Julieta Naranjo , mayor of Usaquén was repetitive to say you can not get sex workers because they have the right to walk the streets of the city without anyone stop you . & quot ; What happens is that there is no sexual activity in public space . So you can not restrict freedom of movement . When a sexual act , police can act , and we are doing , & quot ; said the mayor .

The government has already announced that Daniel Scioli held discounts on teacher salaries for non - working days , between 800 and 2,320 pesos . In the afternoon , at a press conference , the Labour Minister Oscar Cuartango , accompanied by Director General of Culture and Education , Nora Lucy said : & quot ; We have always been respectful of the right to strike . & quot ; Cuartango assured that there will be a new offer of wage increases , because & quot ; we made an effort to offer a sum in respect of teaching materials & quot ; . He concluded : & quot ; The Joint is closed & quot ; .

Questions and answers about the property valuation and property tax Residents complain about the rate increase . Entities answer questions of citizenship . The increase in recent years has had the property valuation base to collect property taxes and recovery , has alarmed some taxpayers . According Cadastral District , this increase is because before 2007 valuations were very low and had fiscal imbalance in the city - oscilaban between 10 and 50 percent of the commercial cost of predio - . However , by 2014 the appraisals are between 70 and 80 percent of the market value of the property . The protesters owners say they are not against payment , but call for greater equity at the time of charge and to take into account the ability to pay . MY TIME ZONE convened a meeting between citizens and authorities to discuss the issue and evaluate possible solutions . These are some of the concerns of the community . How does the housing census ? The Land Registry makes a property census every year to define the commercial value . Officials go through the grounds checking the physical condition of each . Then we mobile devices to see if increased or if its use was modified . That information crosses all the utilities , which say whether it was higher or lower than the usual consumption . Some satellite photographs are also taken into account to check for a change . And the ability to pay ? The Ministry of Planning has made a couple of studies to measure the ability to pay . The first , based on two surveys conducted by the National University and the other by the Dane ( 2004 ) . And a second , made by the company in 2011 , which was applied to about 26,000 households . According to this latest survey , citywide 2 & # 39;800.000 there are about 400,000 homes and have no ability to pay , that is 18 , 9 percent . This year already contracted with the Dane to the same survey ( measuring the same variables and indicators ) . But resizes and expands to 31 neighboring municipalities . The result would be for next year , and this study be updated . Could you collect regardless strata ? The Planning Department has been very restless , long , with a review of stratification . The methodology is national , so the issue of removing the layers is quite complex because it would need to make a change in law ; the District has no competition and would have to be processed before the Congress . We developed a study to determine whether it can be classified by strata cadastral information . Tax reform alternatives studied Management has repeatedly presented a draft tax reform Bogota Council , which seeks to recognize the assessed value of the property * , as the proper reference for the collection of property tax . Unfortunately the proposal has not been able to evolve in the City Council . Continue to insist on presenting the issue to the property valuation is the only reference for the collection of property tax . Given the situation of the interim Mayor , we do not know now what the new guidelines will be , but the important thing is that in Cadastre and the Treasury are fully prepared to resubmit the project . * Currently taking into account socio - economic strata of the premises for the collection of property tax . Bogota was valued clarify that there is no crisis . The concerns that we have received on property taxes do not reach 1 percent of the total required to pay the tax in Bogotรก , which are more than 2 million taxpayers . When you have to correct , it corrected , and when they are not , explain how your tax is settled . The farm reflects the good economic times facing Bogota . The capital has improved their conditions , which makes it more attractive to investors and their land is recovered . As the property tax is calculated on the assessed valuation , it is impossible not modify its value . The performance assessment reflects the dynamics of the city and not to change rates ( for residential or commercial properties ) , because we are using are the same for over a decade .

There are many figures in black and very little increase in the basic salary With this proposal , many retirees are left if receivable want a proposal that respects the wage scale and approach to our claim . . 35 % increase in the basic salary , in one installment , & quot ; he insisted before the NATION the president of the Federation of Teachers Buenos Aires ( FEB ) , Mirta Petrocini .

With the new proposal , the actual increase will be basic in March 2015 , of 26.09 % , and , in practice , means just $ 5 more for each teacher with the previous proposal , & quot ; complained Petrocini . The chief of staff asked teachers to desist from continuing the crackdown . & quot ; We ask you not pressure us with arrest . That boot classes and we continue discussing the wage issue , & quot ; Perez said . But the secretary general of the Unified Education Workers of Buenos Aires ( Suteba ) Union , Roberto Baradel said they will continue with the strike and threatened to march with provincial government employees and doctors . & quot ; We have similar arrangements to those teachers of the central region .

conflict extends to the entire sector and exports management affects the PIT - CNT , UTE union picket gives birth to laboratory UTE The union helped to & quot ; hang & quot ; to the grid to a group of strikers installed in front of the laboratory Bagó Gramon . The Commercial Management of UTE cut the supply was restored after the PIT - CNT management . SIMA says workers were fired for being members . Photo : A.Martinez Topics UTE gives birth to a union picket JUAN PABLO CORREAmar July 15 , 2014 The episode is a derivation of the prolonged conflict between the laboratory Bagó Gramon with the union of the drug ( SIMA ) by the dismissal of two medical representatives that the union means are illegal and that the company claims to be serious irregularities committed by two workers . The nationalist UTE director , Luis Pereira , received an anonymous tip in the sense that the occupants of the tent installed in front of the laboratory Bagó Gramon were & quot ; hanging & quot ; of the grid and managed to cut the supply Commercial Management . Then the PIT - CNT managed to UTE regularization of service and was installed there a counter . Pereira told El Pais that has no evidence that the UTE union has participated in the irregular connection , but said that at a time when the state - owned combat energy theft , the situation could not let go and & quot ; I could not I remain silent . & quot ; Edgardo Oyenard , drug syndicate leader and member of the Executive Secretariat of the PIT - CNT , assured the country that initially had & quot ; solidarity & quot ; UTE union ( AUTE ) . & quot ; Now we ask the counter and pay for what they consume . We are not thieves or the state or anyone else . We are a union . If they think we & # 39 ; re going to go cold , they are wrong , & quot ; said the trade unionist . By the tent happens every day almost a hundred people and within & quot ; a couple of stoves and radio , & quot ; said Oyenard . The conflict seems far from a solution . Oyenard said & quot ; it is not over SIMA , is the PIT - CNT & quot ; , so the trade union held a ceremony Thursday on the picket line . The company argued that dismissed the two medical representatives visits because they said customers do not actually performed , which in the industry is considered a serious offense . Oyenard said the four medical representatives , the company sought to dismiss three were unionized & quot ; by illegitimate methods . & quot ; One of the dismissals did not materialize by intervention of the Ministry of Labour , he said . The two medical representatives were fired five months ago and offered to pay a higher dismissal which would have legally returned . & quot ; I said no . It & # 39 ; s not about money , it & # 39 ; s dignity . They are parents , have children and do not want kids to think they were fired for lying . What they want is restitution , & quot ; said Oyenard . The SIMA is performing around the arrests Twelfth ten minutes each day . It was decided to involve the entire local drug industry , Oyenard said , because the Association of National Laboratories did not have a & quot ; proactive & quot ; to reverse the dismissals . Sources of the Association of National Laboratories told El Pais that is being affected a sector that brings together 30 companies and the risk of losing export business to run Venezuela . The business association believes that the union violated the & quot ; peace clause & quot ; of the three - year wage agreement signed in November 2013 and has approached the ministries of Health , Labor and Industry . According to the union , it is difficult to quantify the impact of the measure because the level of compliance with the strikes is uneven and depends on the level of unionization of workers in each company . According to the employers , benefit from the situation & quot ; importers swallow medicines or have offices here . & quot ; The association proposed to the union that it rejected arbitration . Oyenard said the SIMA interrupted for a couple of weeks , & quot ; pearled strikes & quot ; as a gesture of relaxation , but as it did not change the attitude of the company decided to union strikes . Several markets in the local sector of the drug industry work 3,000 people on staff and 1,500 contracted . The industry sells to Brazil , Venezuela , Paraguay , Central America and some Asian countries such as Vietnam . His union is considered one of the strongest . Vote for this article :

He demanded the governor Javier Duarte de Ochoa that the performance of the head of the SSP , Arturo Bermudez Zurita , are investigated by stopping the trucks and the shooting committed by a member of the state corporation . & quot ; It is not worth , far from protecting our physical integrity think we have to beating about taking care of the police , is aberrant ( sic ) , thankfully no injuries , but was ten centimeters to give him in the head companion That was because the Ministry of Public Security stopped us when there is a law of free movement in Mexico , & quot ; he charged . The arrests of protesters in the north and center of the state & quot ; are symbols of the disease & quot ; of the government and its inability to solve the needs of citizens who demand their right to security , public works , education , potable water and electricity , he said President of the State Executive Committee ( EEC ) Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) , Sergio Rodríguez Cortés . At a press conference the PRD charged that by order of the Secretary of Public Security , Arturo Bermudez Zurita , state police arrested about 2 thousand inhabitants of the municipalities of San Andrés Tenejapan and Soledad Atzompa in Cordoba - Fortin de las Flores and highway Tlaquilpa the Township on state road from Totutla to Coatepec .

However , & quot ; the straw that broke the camel & # 39 ; s back & quot ; was the highest official of the Ministry of Education of Veracruz ( SEV ) , Vicente Benitez refused to authorize 150 tele - desks for students of Soledad Atzompa , said the PRD . & quot ; It can not be that these signs of government breakdown , because there are increasing signs when a patient is wrong and that is increasingly serious , we see these events in Xalapa , are continuous demonstrations , the truth is that officials government are not serious , his work is done wrong and now even allow citizens to speak out , we are not in accordance with law , & quot ; said Rodríguez Cortés . At the mention of the bill proposed by the PRI Deputy Adolfo Ramirez Arana to regulate the marches , demonstrations and sit - ins of Veracruz , PRD leader accused the SSP interrupted by the arrival of the protesters of these three municipalities , so that do not come to Xalapa to manifest . He said that two months ago the CFE began charging energy occupied by the pumping system to bring water to remote communities of the 23 municipalities comprising the district Zongolica , of which 16 are located in hilly areas . He said that the federal government promised to fight hunger in rural communities , however with energy charging citizens for the benefit of drinking water , poverty worsens . & quot ; It is possible that the federal government is so incongruous , so stupid to think that people have money to pay for the energy that brings them water , if people have nothing to eat , or to send their children to school if not there are programs for the field , but have to pay for the pumping system , & quot ; he said . The demonstrations and blockades by protesters citizens roads are proof of the inability of the state and municipal governments to not give answers to the requests of the population , not knowing how to reconcile interests , said PRD federal deputy Uriel Flores Aguayo . In this regard , he blamed the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) of orchestrating the demonstrations and blockades against state government officials who have political interests in common , going to affect the people in the capital and elsewhere in the state . & quot ; Much of what is experienced by xalapeños ineptitude of authorities liderzuelos demagoguery , and by the system , there are many groups that are PRI : Cardenistas , Antorcha Campesina , 400 towns , all those operating for the system , with deputies do campaigns , carry people , would have to ask Elizabeth Morales and the new local leader of the PRI do you think of the protests , because xalapeños not have to pay the piper , jueguitos system , & quot ; he said . The congressman acknowledged that the glut of business establishments in the first frame of the city that have complained about poor sales , resulting from blockades and demonstrations in front of government palace . & quot ; This is an example of how the PRI hates Xalapa , because these blockages are caused by the same PRI with their affinity groups , and this is an affront , an insult and a mind true mother for xalapeños we suffer this , & quot ; .

Clearly , the czars of the media and successful entrepreneurs are behind this campaign to discredit unions . Obviously , they do not suit them the existence of trade unions in a country . Unionism has been the sole author of a noble deed that world commemorates the May 1 , than noble deeds have led entrepreneurs ? ? . If we go back in history entrepreneurs have always wanted for them all profits and benefits even subjecting workers to inhumane work . And from this abject treatment comes all the great fortunes , Paraguay is no exception to this rule . Another case that is abundantly clear is that behind all this there is a black hand and Rothschild oligopoly is spreading its dark tentacles in our country through these media czars , successful businessmen , parliamentarians and government traitors , De desmonopolizarse and privatized ANDE , they would take control of the power , imposing rates , types and quality of services and consequently opened the door for Rio Tinto ALCAN between envaselinado as by a tube to Paraguay , preying and polluting our lands and appropriating our energy Baron Rothschild is one of the main shareholder who commands more than one hundred strategic companies , including Rio Tinto Alcan , Bunge and Born , Monsanto , Cargill and others . Those who in their free will happily rant against unions and decentralized companies should measure the meaning and scope of his words , as this measure applied generating catastrophic consequences of serious social conflicts everywhere . So much so that schools , colleges and centers of the interior would be without electricity , as well as public forces , added to this the social tariff that automatically disappear and thousands of families remain in the dark . Private companies do not perdorian a second non - payment . The national cement because ANDE several million dollars , who will assume the debt , and pay as if privatized , this will generate layoffs . To date ANDE plays a highly social role , ministries and decentralized entities receive each year in their respective budgets the business to pay the energy consumed , ie ANDE with great altruism and patriotism keeps running the state and the people . The press SITRANDE luguista no trend , let alone even Bolshevik , however his article Mr. Master in Power Systems falls into complete and utter incongruity , wandering in an inextricable labyrinth of foul and incomprehensible argument . The press SITRANDE is the wake - up call to the people to the apparent theft of which will be . Your article is so inconsistent and incoherent Lord Master , because states that ANDE will remain unchanged , and this is where it reveals its insidious malice because as the monopolization of ANDE will take place if nothing changed . If nothing changes do not need a regulator , but rather , ANDE need to update and modernize its existing facilities and transmission lines , this will be achieved by returning autarky ANDE which was cruelly stripped by greedy politicians , rapiñeros and cancellation of intergovernmental resource contribution subtracted ANDE fifteen million dollars annually . With this reinvestment efficiency and effectiveness of ANDE improve facilities superlative . ANDE as a decentralized company must bring an acceptable percentage of their profits without falling into the state larceny . Demonopolization is unworkable because the generation , transmission and distribution is handled by a business and the territory we possess only appropriate generation company , one transmission company and a distribution company . Our territory is not extensive as Argentina , Brazil , Colombia or the US , where if you can live and compete several companies hoist a regulator that controls a paragraph In Lord Master & # 39 ; s right , the power sector is a huge Paraguay industry and was not exploited , it is because of its assertion that the large scavengers are crouching capital to give the savage blow to a good of the people in such a way to hurt and leave adrift of his most prized possession .

Conflict threatens grain export soy not reached an agreement tomorrow , the country star will not find plantation output + - 04 / 06 / 2013 , 9:39 am - 9:54 UPDATED Text : - A / A + © Juan Samuelle Started soy transfer into silos © Juan Samuelle started moving towards soy silos Photo + - 04 / 06 / 2013 , 9:39 am - 9:54 UPDATED Text : - A / A + The Uruguayan Federation of grain companies ( Futec ) yesterday blocked the port of Nueva Palmira and several silos on the coast , seeking to obtain better pay El Pais reported Tuesday . The measure entered into a truce until tomorrow at 11:00 , when the union will meet with the Minister of Livestock , Agriculture and Fisheries , Tabaré Aguerre . In the case of not reaching an agreement it will be re blockades indefinitely . The cost of each vessel per day in port is around $ 20,000 , so , to become a protracted conflict would result in a considerable loss for cargo , in addition to the million loss means not export the star plantation from the country . According to the provisions of the morning , although in Black River Soriano and measures were taken , the main lock is held in Cologne , since the load of soybeans amid a successful harvest is prevented . This move comes after six months of negotiations in the wage councils . The workers are demanding a 5 % improvement while companies offering 2.9 % . Wilson Acosta member of Futec told El Pais : & quot ; This to have partners working between the dust and poison agrochemicals for $ 10,300 is really shameful With this we seek to draw the attention of the employers but also the government form . gradually try to approach the average basket ( . . . ) & quot ; We are entering the sixth month of negotiation and no agreement has been reached with the industry & # 39 ; s multibillion - dollar grains only offers 2.9 % & quot ; said the unionist . In addition said wages wealth in the sector . The green gold Uruguay Farmers and all who depend on them these days have an eye in the sky and the other on the farms is not reflected . And if not , watch the screen . notebook to follow the evolution of the price of soybeans on the Chicago Board of rainfall depends much of the foreign currency into the country by the new green gold of the Uruguayan countryside . soy private consultants estimate that the harvested area 2013 will be over one million hectares , considering that after the survey international prices and demand for soybeans remain firm and , moreover , in the harvest of winter crops fared poorly wheat . So , many farmers all tickets to soybean planting gambled everything they could to correct the numbers in red wheat left them . Last year , as official data , 875,900 hectares were up 2,112,000 tons with an average yield of 2,390 kilos per hectare . If in the autumn performance achieved is only slightly higher than last year , they could pick up from the end of March at least 2.5 million tons of the oilseed , a new record . Star cultivation Uruguay , on the other hand , generates controversy over the handling and use of soils . For good land conservation is vital the stubble - remnants of stalks and leaves that remain after the harvest , because it covers the earth and minimizes erosion caused by the rain . Soy has a particularity : once extracted from the earth leaves no residue . That is counterproductive if producers growing abuse and do not apply the proper sequence interspersed rotation or other planting soybeans . For the director of Renewable Natural Resources and the Ministry of Livestock , Agriculture and Fisheries , Mariana Hill , the gist of 50 years from now is & quot ; how to put soybeans in the system and not the system based on soy . & quot ; The tool to achieve the goal will be implemented from 2013 . The Winter Use Plan and Land Management comes to rearrange existing regulations and address the root to the short - term production . The aim is to plan crops depending on the quality of the land . In the first stage , an affidavit will be required to producers of wheat and barley planted over 100 hectares . The plan is to commit to a succession of cultures and a way of working that does not generate losses greater erosion that tolerates every piece of territory .

However , Nicolas Maduro , without technical information about what happened , he quickly described as strange and abrupt electrical fault has been recorded , later denouncing irresponsible that this was a test of electric shock , accusing the opposition of being the cause of this unfortunate situation , nothing new , particularly in the hinterland . Again sabotage becomes for Maduro and government propaganda , the cause of the blackout , not to mention the electricity crisis that suffers Venezuela since 2008 and has not been resolved . & quot ; He recalled that the MUD has reported on several occasions that Corpoelec has concentrated investment in power plants and has neglected the transmission and distribution systems .

He regretted that , although in Parliament have approved more than $ 30 billion to supply the ready power demand Venezuelans persist system failures , which , in his view , shows the ineptitude of the Government . & quot ; The power outage experienced on Tuesday is the largest in history and it is all due to lack of support , centralism and corruption , which is what characterizes this Government . That says tackling corruption , but does not finish dismantling their own ranks and it & # 39 ; s unfortunate that the citizens pay the consequences , & quot ; he said . Deputy Nicolas Maduro invited Chacon and to investigate additional appropriations to be approved in Parliament for the electrical system , the destination of these resources , and subject matter experts to present evidence showing what has happened in the main line transmission , wherein the power failure is generated . The leader of Popular Will David Smolansky went along with militants from that organization to the headquarters of the Ministry of Electric Power blackout to protest and demand the immediate resignation of the minister Chacón & quot ; to prove , once again , your disability ; this after the blackout that affected 15 states for more than six hours . & quot ; The data Councilman Alejandro Vivas , on behalf of Primero Justicia , rejected the talk of & quot ; sabotage & quot ; electrical system if the facilities were guarded by the fanbase . He said the government has invested $ 209 million in electricity abroad and more than 86 billion dollars for the electrical system in Venezuela , but blackouts persist .

Young people stress the need for citizens to demand avoquen rights due to them by the government such as respect for life , employment opportunities and ensuring a truly productive economy that allows the development of every Venezuelan family . The call made by these young people is not to give up in finding solutions that ensure a better Venezuela .

A new educational unemployment and unacceptable regains hostage more than three million students in the province of Buenos Aires since yesterday , when the school year should be resumed after the winter break . As a result of the strike , students would return only to have classes tomorrow , but may not be ruled out more arrests in coming days , demanding a & quot ; monitoring & quot ; of changes in the cost of living and a possible revision of the guideline wage increase scheduled for this year . Thus , they would strike 19 days in the Buenos Aires district in 2014 , added the 17 - day strike that took place early in the school year . If that number of days classless holidays and traditional holidays called bridge are added , the days when classes are missed nearly a month to arrive . While no one can deny the deleterious effect that inflation generated in the pockets of absolutely all workers , we must reiterate that the sectors involved in this protest should seek to overcome conflicts other ways that do not affect students and their families and does not bring into play the inalienable right of children to education . In the global knowledge society , the most important is human capital , now has no borders . The best human resources come from any country . - private Large employers , foundations , multilateral organizations and governments to seek their talent regardless of nationality or origin . It would seem that in Argentina live in another reality , or that the main actors of this tragedy is the quality of education in the country or the lack of it does not understand where the world is going . We & # 39 ; re not just in the last positions of the PISA test educational evaluation , but also have a 50 % drop , while fewer adults graduate from university and teachers & # 39 ; unions allow students again without classes . The harm to students used to be only at the beginning of the year , but has now begun to occur following the winter break as well . Union leaders are demonstrating a while his lack of interest in the educational status of the students . However , the rest of society does not react . The impression remains that as we get used to the pickets , roadblocks or personal attacks reviewers government towards different , does not surprise us that a group of teachers that really for years has left the classrooms decides million students they can not attend school . Education is everyone & # 39 ; s responsibility . Where , then , other sectors of society interested in having a more educated population ? Where are the politicians , business leaders , parent groups , leaders of civil society and the media ? Why no one claims them back classes as soon as possible ? Entrepreneurs require trained personnel , is their interest to do so ; social leaders understand better than anyone the importance of an educated democratic values , tolerance and mutual respect in society . Education is too important to be left solely in the hands of politicians , and in recent decades have learned that have never been as real priority , discursive or even less in the action . Of little use communication campaigns from the Presidency of the Nation , in which our officials boast of building countless schools , free distribution of books or netbooks and the actions of teacher training , when Argentina can not guarantee in some of its most important districts , attendance at school for at least 190 days , as established by national objectives . Social reaction , increased demand for educational reform is needed from the rest of society . Only then leaders understand that education can not be left hostage to students without the necessary school hours without the knowledge and skills necessary to defend minimally demanding labor market in the twenty - first century . Educational reforms have always been accompanied by the support of society or promoted by voters . It is time that we demand in Argentina leaders , including politicians first , a better education , or be too late to compete with the rest of the world . .

Saturday March 8 , 2014 , 1:00 Women continue to lead unemployment and low pay Photo : Facebook . Attachment 1 January Apparently there is now equity between genders , but wage differences in favor of men and against women persist . At the country level , most of them receive 30 % less than men . 0 Women in Asuncion march demanding respect for their rights in the country there is an apparent balance between men and women in terms of quantity and also in attendance ; however , when you want to access the labor market and the problem arises . Unemployment remains higher among women , Norma Medina , director of household surveys of the Directorate General of Statistics , Surveys and Censuses ( DGEEC ) said . He said , though currently there is equity in training , there is a gap in favor of men and against women . & quot ; For example , in the Central and Assumption department , it can be seen that the rate of female unemployment is higher , that is , while 7 100 men are openly unemployed , 9 100 women are in the same situation , & quot ; . He said that this result may be related to lifestyle or type of labor required and that is more associated with what the boys . Moreover , he added that gender pay gap persist . On average , women earn 70 % of what men earn , that is , 30 % less . This aspect can be the product of several factors , both cultural and social . & quot ; It happens that , at the same level of study , a woman is earning less . But you have to control this level of study corresponds to what kind of career , because while women made 5 - year career in Science Education to be licensed , the men also studied 5 years , but at the Polytechnic School for computer engineers , & quot ; he said . Then , years of study are the same , but the races for the men who chose to involve higher pay and women , however , go to those programs that are rather extended perhaps housework such as teaching , nursing and other , Indian . Biases . & quot ; Making a rating between both genders in scientific commissions , professionals , intellectuals , there is a similar concentration . The difference arises in management positions , as there are more men involved in this activity group & quot ; , he said . He clarified that in the private sector is where most big differences and inequities happen . & quot ; This fact is explained , according to polls , because private firms prefer men because they do not require permits , such as maternity or children who become ill or school , & quot ; he said . While & quot ; in the public sector there is a bias towards men , in contrast , public institutions are attempting to combat disparities , & quot ; he said . He gave the example that if a pregnant descontrata , a whole society can go over this situation , which can not happen in private , to be more independent . What do you think about this new ?

Universities Society : not improve supply and Tomorrow conflict worsens adds to unemployment and inactivity Conadu provides almost total government and teachers & # 39 ; unions met yesterday but trading continues locked . Ezequiel shares Viéitez The conflict in public universities for delays in wage increases continues . And it gets worse . Yesterday failed joint meeting new teachers and federations confirmed crackdown . So , tomorrow , unemployment feel strongly in almost all universities and most high schools and colleges . In this context , the Minister of Education , Alberto Sileoni , convened a new meeting for this afternoon , the fifth to be carried forward . But expectations are not favorable . Although there was talk of making the last offer , yesterday asked the government time and did not make a specific proposal at a meeting which was just over 45 minutes . Teachers come to reject an overall rise of 28.7 % , which is formed with a first share increase of 16.5 % to be collected in August and another 10.5 % , payable in October . But this increase would not impact the average Christmas gift . Alongside were Sileoni University Policies Secretary , Aldo Caballero , and the president of the National Inter - University Council , Dario Maiorana . & quot ; The minister promised that tomorrow ( today ) to 16 will bring an overcoming offer , but gave no details , & quot ; said the secretary general of the federation Conadu - the most national - level representation , Pedro Sanllorenti . Therefore , unemployment morning convened the partnership remains strong . & quot ; We believe Sileoni has good predisposition , but it seems that from the Cabinet not authorized to improve the offer , & quot ; he told Clarin Claudia Baigorria , assistant secretary of Conadu Historic , one of the six federations of unions yesterday participated in the meeting , as he left the meeting that was done in the Pizzurno Palace . That group said the strike until Friday ( take 20 days to strike this year ) , with different levels of compliance will be fulfilled in 27 universities and 50 junior colleges . Two other union federations confirmed that add to the protests . Fedun will strike on Wednesday and Fagdun , which brings together 15 000 teachers from across the country in the National Technological University ( UTN ) , last night began a strike that will end late Wednesday . For that reason , today and tomorrow there will be no classes in the 31 branches of the UTN . Through a statement , he criticized the official Fagdun & quot ; meager offering . & quot ; & quot ; We believe the deal could be closer if the total supply exceeded 30 % , but that would be necessary to meet various requirements , such as bringing forward the payment of two installments offered increase and payment of a defined percentage by nesting & quot ; for educators not earn less than the non - teaching staff , said the secretary general of Conadu . In this federation also asked to pay an extra percentage for the & quot ; nomenclature & quot ; which would improve the pay scale .

As the group of motorcyclists called & quot ; indignant & quot ; protesters by this breach , in parallel did another group that circulated through the streets of the city and claimed the lack of commitment by the authorities . Mellado Octavio Camacho recalled , last year the governor Javier Duarte de Ochoa signed a decree to subsidize tenure until 2016 to natural persons owning motorcycles with a value of up to 100,000 pesos plus VAT . But according to testimony , Sefiplan has failed and at least 1,500 motorcyclists were unable emplacar because when they indicate that they have to pay between 3000 and 4000 pesos for this tax . Those affected have gone to the State Treasury offices to comply with the law to obtain their badges and be regularized , but found that they still continue to claim the payment of tenure for same reason that could not get their badges new . & quot ; The holding was not eliminated and the State Treasury does not deliver the plates until they pay the holdings . The governor announced that it had already been eliminated . & quot ; In this regard , they recalled that this allowance announced in June last year , argued that until 2016 would the elimination of tenure , plus the tax is eliminated , fines and retroactive charges from 2007 to date and just want is met . Not being respected the word will travel to Xalapa to Sefiplan and have no answer as to forgiveness program , will be next Monday when again manifest in the park on May 21 . For his part , the head of the State Tax area , Bernardo Pelaez said that the decree does apply , except that it is done under certain reservations . However , he said , is to analyze each case to the agreement , ie it can be applied , the driver should not have any debt of any other kind to the Treasury , because if so , automatically you lose the Another aspect support have been detected between this union , is selling one another owner , but do not come to complete this process , and sometimes take up to five sales without update which adds a serious debt that just how do you automatically lose this benefit . & quot ; If you bring a new bike immediately and pay your right of control , we are talking to 700 pesos and emplacaste , but if you bring a bike that has five years of right vehicle control and has four endorsements , obviously the price is going four thousand pesos . & quot ; That is , the decree if applied without any debits but unfortunately mostly comes to humble people who avoid paying endorsement and therefore scores debts . He said this applies to all those owners of motor units , not just one sector and those who enjoy this subsidy only have no outstanding debts to the State Treasury .
